- lua error fix.

v8:
- code:
	- deleted check for useful resources at the lua file load (now only on window opening left),

- UI:
	- made "..." mark for "Other luxury resources" more visible (orange),
	- fixed alignment like always,
- files:
	- renamed few folders and files.

v7:
- new version numbering system: dropped "28m" part because mod was changed so hard including code refining; now any version starts counting from "v7".
- resources:
	- added Paper to "Strategics" part,
	- added "Other luxury resources" to "Luxuries" part; makes all mod which add new luxuries compatible with TO; significantly reworked basic feature.
- UI:
	- totally reworked "Colour Key" tab,
	- totally new colour palette in main window:
		- cyan or blue - one or more cities respectively demands that resource (unavailable for non-active players),
		- dark green, light green, yellowish green - player has more than 3, 1 or equal to 1 tradable resource copies respectively:
			- yellowish green is not available for non-active players.
		- orange - player has no tradable resources,
		- red - new category: player uses more resources than he has (has deficit - means that he uses imported ones from CSs or from other players),
		- brownish grey - rest of cases; new grey colour is much darker; now other colours are visible at first glance.
	- now numbers are centred in the window instead of aligned to the right,
	- new markers:
		- ' shows strategic monopoly bonus for the resource,
		- " shows strategic global bonus for the resource.
	- bigger "No player met" text label,
	- "War" status is now moved to the right; red background shows up instead with increased opacity; it now does not hide content below (you can still see numbers underneath),
	- now different columns' colours for luxury (light gold) and strategic (light silver) resources,
	- added ICON_CAPITAL icon before capital city on list with cities demanding some resource; added icon, name and some generic text; city names coloured,
	- added icon, name and some generic text for unavailable resources,
	- deleted resource icon before city-state name in tooltip,
	- slightly scaled down CS icons to better fit the frames,
	- added "Monopoly bonus" info to resource icon (header) tooltip,
	- added "Current Deals" tooltip separate for every non-active player,
	- few things moved in the main and City-State windows for better alignment.
- code:
	- cleaned UI xml code,
	- cleaned and refined main lua code,
	- fixed resource calculation: now it takes also resource used for units or buildings into account,
	- hovering over CS icon shows all its resources instead of only strategic ones,
	- reduced spoiler informations:
		- now player on start can see only its own resources,
		- during exploration, after meeting new players, new sources are "discovered",
		- code checks available resources and resources in nearby area from cities,
		- fixed resource logic for strategics: same like in CSL mod (now shows resource visible for active player not for target player; means that if active player researches iron then it will be searched for every other player including CSs):
			- hovering the CS's icon still shows resources improved by that CS.
